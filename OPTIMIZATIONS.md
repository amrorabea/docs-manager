# Codebase Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations made to the docs-manager application while preserving its core functionality.

## Backend Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Server Configuration
- Added rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- Improved error handling with a global error handler
- Added 404 handling for unmatched routes
- Made MongoDB connection more robust with better error handling
- Implemented environment-based configuration for frontend URL

### 2. Improved Data Models
- Enhanced validation in the Policy model with detailed error messages
- Added indexing to improve query performance
- Implemented virtual properties for derived data (e.g., days until expiry)
- Added compound indexes for frequently queried combinations
- Added automatic calculation of approval validity dates
- Added URL validation for file links

## Frontend Optimizations

### 1. API Service Improvements
- Implemented a caching system for GET requests to reduce server load
- Added request debouncing to prevent duplicate requests
- Improved token refresh mechanism to use a single refresh promise
- Enhanced error handling and response processing
- Added cache invalidation functionality

### 2. Custom Hook for API Requests
- Created a reusable `useApi` hook for consistent data fetching
- Implemented automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Added request cancellation to prevent race conditions
- Provided unified interface for loading, error, and data states
- Implemented cache management within the hook

## Security Enhancements

- Improved CORS configuration
- Added Helmet for HTTP security headers
- Implemented compression for reduced payload size
- Enhanced JWT handling and token refresh logic

## Performance Improvements

- Added database indexes for faster queries
- Implemented data caching
- Added request debouncing and cancellation
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Enhanced MongoDB connection pooling configuration

## Maintainability Improvements

- Added better error messages
- Enhanced code organization
- Implemented more consistent patterns
- Added data validation for better data integrity

These optimizations improve the application's performance, security, and reliability while maintaining the original functionality and concept.
